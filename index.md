# Rainbow Recipes

## [Team Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ii8JpiN7N2ggNPNK966_UyXlzq3T6nzf9zWfuArA9YU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Goals for the project
*Problem*: Many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints. As a result, college students spend money to eat out, or eat non-healthy foods at fast food places or through vending machines.

*Solution*: Rainbow Recipes creates a way for students (on-campus or off) to learn and share recipes that:
* Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a toaster oven).
* Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH.
* Suit local taste sensibilities.
* Can be filtered via dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc).
* Have an estimated cost per serving.
* Has an estimated number of servings per recipe.
* Has an estimate of how long it takes to make.

### Approach
There are three roles in this system: students, vendors, and admins:
* Students can both search for and contribute recipes.
* Vendors (local grocery stores and/or farmer’s markets) can login and establish a profile including their location and hours. 
* Admins can edit all content in the system, remove inappropriate content, and establish users as having the vendor role.

Mockup page ideas:
* Landing page
* User home page
* Admin home page
* Vendor home page
* User profile page
* Search recipe page
* Individual recipe page

### Use case ideas
* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, browses recipes.

### Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
* Maps for locating vendors.
* Based upon open hours for vendors, indicate which ingredients can be bought right now.
* Ratings and review system for recipes.
* Ratings and review system for vendors.
* Notification system for vendors when new items are posted in recipes so they can update their listing to indicate whether they stock it or not.
* Notification system when price for a recipe drops substantially (i.e. a vendor puts an item on sale.)
